# Data-Preprocessing

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for Data Preprocessing, created as an assignment for Data Engineering course. It demonstrates various data preprocessing steps, including data cleaning, feature adjustment, data integration, and data reduction. 

## Features

1. Data Cleaning: This section covers fundamental techniques for identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in the dataset. It includes handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and correcting data types.
2. Feature Adjustment: This part focuses on transforming and creating features to enhance the quality and relevance of the data.
3. Data Integration: This section highlights the use of correlation and covariance analysis to detect redundant attributes.
4. Data Reduction: This section delves into techniques for reducing the dimensionality of the dataset, specifically using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
